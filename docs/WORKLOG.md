### Done
- Refactored `src/` into domain-based subpackages: `data/`, `training/`, `inference/`, `monitoring/`, `deployment/`
- Removed reversed dependencies from `scripts/` into `src/`
- Added backward-compatibility shim modules
- Verified `python -m compileall src -q` — clean
- Verified `pytest -q` — 258/258 passed
- Restructured `docs/` into organized subdirectories: `01_PIPELINE/`, `02_TECH/`, `03_EXPERIMENTS/`, `04_THESIS_WRITING/`, `99_ARCHIVE/`
- Created pipeline stage documentation (stages 01–10)
- Created thesis writing guides, chapter drafts, research Q&A, mentor questions
- Moved archived docs to `99_ARCHIVE/` and `thesis/_snapshots/`
- Improved CD workflow: added debug endpoints step, robust multi-route smoke test (`/openapi.json` → `/health` → `/api/health` → `/`)
- Created paper catalog (`archive/_index/PAPERS_CATALOG.md`)
- Organized 76 research PDFs into `thesis/refs/papers_all/` (6 topic folders)
- Created `thesis/refs/papers_all/READING_LIST_BY_CHAPTER.md` — chapter-to-paper mapping
- Created `docs/WORKLOG.md` — this file
- **Fixed Docker build failure**: `docker/Dockerfile.inference` referenced deleted `api/` folder
  - Changed `COPY api/ /app/api/` → `COPY src/ /app/src/`
  - Changed `CMD uvicorn api.main:app` → `CMD uvicorn src.api.app:app`
  - Updated `PYTHONPATH=/app` → `PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/src`
  - Updated `HEALTHCHECK` to try `/health` then `/api/health` then `/openapi.json`
  - Root cause: refactor moved API from `api/` to `src/api/app.py` but Dockerfile was not updated

- `tests/test_baseline_update.py` — updated imports
- `docker/Dockerfile.inference` — fixed COPY path, CMD entrypoint, PYTHONPATH, HEALTHCHECK
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml` — debug step + 60-iteration wait + multi-route smoke test
- `docs/01_PIPELINE/stages/` — 10 new stage documentation files (01–10)
- `docs/02_TECH/guides/` — 8 new operation guides
- `docs/03_EXPERIMENTS/` — evidence pack, threshold calibration summary
- `docs/04_THESIS_WRITING/` — chapter drafts, mentor Q&A, research analysis
- `docs/99_ARCHIVE/` — archived old doc files
- `thesis/_snapshots/` — historical work snapshots (Feb snapshots)
- `archive/_index/PAPERS_CATALOG.md` — 76-paper categorized index

- `thesis/refs/papers_all/READING_LIST_BY_CHAPTER.md` — chapter-to-paper map
- `docs/WORKLOG.md` — this file (new)

### Why
- Flat `src/` had 30+ modules — hard to navigate and explain in thesis
- Reversed dependencies (scripts importing src, src importing scripts) made the codebase fragile
- `docker/Dockerfile.inference` was never updated after the API moved from `api/` to `src/api/`
- CD smoke test had insufficient wait time and no debug visibility
- Docs were scattered with no clear organization
- Papers were spread across multiple archive folders with no single library

### Status
- Refactor complete and tests passing (258/258)
- Docker build error fixed — `COPY api/` → `COPY src/`
- CD workflow improved and tag `v0.9.1` pushed
- Docs restructured into 4 clear categories
- 76 PDFs organized into thesis paper library

### Next
- Verify CD passes with `v0.9.1` tag run
- Run full pipeline locally: `python run_pipeline.py`
- Confirm `/api/health` endpoint responds in container

---

## 2026-03-05
### Done
- Updated March TODO planning docs
- Fixed CI workflow issues
- Split combined CI/CD into separate `ci.yml` and `cd.yml` workflows
- Documented CI/CD triggers and structure
- Fixed CD workflow and inference container configuration

### Files / Areas Affected
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — new standalone CI
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml` — new standalone CD
- `docker/Dockerfile.inference` — inference container fixes

### Why
- Combined workflow was hard to debug and had conflicting triggers
- CI and CD have different trigger conditions (push/PR vs tags)

### Status
- CI green
- CD not yet green (smoke test failing — route/startup issue)

### Next
- Debug actual container routes with enhanced smoke test
- Validate refactored `src/` structure

---

## 2026-02-25 – 2026-02-26
### Done
- MiKTeX installation for LaTeX thesis compilation
- README update

### Files / Areas Affected
- `auto-install=yes/` — MiKTeX package files
- `README.md`

### Status
- LaTeX toolchain available for thesis compilation

---

## 2026-02-22 – 2026-02-23
### Done
- Major bug fix sprint: aligned code to 11 anxiety behavior classes (was using wrong PAMAP2 class list)
- Fixed train.py architecture to match pretrained model (~499K params, not ~1.5M)
- Fixed Docker container: resolved `api.app` module shadowing, set correct PYTHONPATH
- Fixed CI/CD: switched Docker to `src/api/app.py`, poll loop replaces `sleep 10`, corrected `/health` → `/api/health`
- Fixed Stage 11 crash — TTA governance registration fallback
- Renamed `psi_warn` → `drift_zscore_warn` (threshold 2.0σ / 3.0σ) with thesis parameter citations
- Fixed Stage 7 — reads `drift_zscore_warn` after rename
- Comprehensive cross-code audit of all markdown files
- Reformatted `train.py` for black compliance
- Config updates
- Moved thesis writing docs to `Thesis_report/` (local-only, gitignored)

### Files / Areas Affected
- `src/active_learning_export.py` — fixed class list
- `tests/conftest.py` — fixture uses correct 11 classes
- `src/train.py` — architecture alignment + black formatting
- `docker/Dockerfile.inference` — PYTHONPATH fix
- `.github/workflows/` — CI/CD route fixes
- `README.md` — corrected params, endpoints, progress
- Multiple docs — cross-code audit corrections
- `config/pipeline_config.yaml` — threshold rename

### Why
- Wrong class list caused silent data integrity issues
- Model param count mismatch between docs and code
- Docker shadowing caused container startup failures
- Threshold naming was inconsistent across codebase

### Status
- 215 tests passing after fixes
- CI green
- CD still failing on smoke test

---

## 2026-02-19
### Done
- Fixed baseline + metric loss bugs
- Added missing `build_training_baseline.py`, saved normalized baseline, exposed tent/adabn_tent in CLI
- Hardened PSI test, schema guard in Stage 6, schema_version, artifact baseline copy
- Split unit/slow tests, fixed artifact copy guard, marked TF tests as slow
- Thesis closure: traceability docs, audit script, fixed pseudo-label pipeline
- Fixed TENT running-stats freeze + rollback, baseline governance, GPU detection
- Fixed baseline governance (no `models/` write when not promoting), TENT confidence-drop rollback
- Fixed `tf.function` retracing, GPU diagnostic message, MLflow `name=` fix
- Reorganized Feb 19 docs into `docs/19_Feb/`
- Reorganized docs into archive/technical/research/thesis structure

### Files / Areas Affected
- `src/build_training_baseline.py` — new
- `src/tent_adaptation.py`, `src/adabn_adaptation.py` — TENT fixes
- `tests/` — PSI test fix, slow test markers
- `config/pipeline_config.yaml` — schema_version added
- Multiple doc reorganization

### Why
- TENT freeze/rollback was unsafe — could corrupt model on bad batches
- Schema validation was missing in Stage 6
- Test suite needed separation of fast/slow tests for CI efficiency
- Pseudo-label pipeline had safety issues

### Status
- All tests passing
- Pipeline hardened
- Docs reorganized

- GitHub Actions settings configured

### Files / Areas Affected
- `src/api/app.py` — new FastAPI application
- `.github/workflows/` — CI/CD workflows
- `docker/Dockerfile.inference` — Docker build
- Multiple docs — progress consolidation

### Why
- Needed serving layer for inference API
- Needed automated CI/CD for thesis demonstration

- Removed large image and model files from git tracking (moved to .gitignore)

### Files / Areas Affected
- `src/` — full pipeline implementation
- `.gitignore` — added model/image exclusions
- `run_pipeline.py` — pipeline orchestration

### Why
- Large binary files were bloating repo
- AdaBN domain adaptation is a core thesis contribution

### Status

---

## 2025-10-23 – 2025-10-25
### Done
- Initial commit with structured files and folders
- Data preprocessing pipeline created

## Current Repo Status
- **Branch:** `chore/docs-restructure`
- **Tests:** 258/258 passing
- **CI:** Green
- **CD:** Docker build fixed (`COPY src/` + `uvicorn src.api.app:app`), tag `v0.9.1` pushed
- **Refactor:** `src/` domain subpackages complete
- **Docs:** Restructured into 4 categories

## Open Issues
1. CD not yet confirmed green — `v0.9.1` run in progress
2. Full pipeline not yet run end-to-end on real data after refactor

## Recommended Next 3 Actions
1. Confirm CD green from `v0.9.1` run — check `/api/health` responds
2. Run `python run_pipeline.py` on real data locally
3. Wire docs into thesis chapters using `READING_LIST_BY_CHAPTER.md`
