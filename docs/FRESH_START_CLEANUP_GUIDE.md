# Complete Fresh Start Guide - Clean All Old Records & DVC Cache

**Date:** December 12, 2025  
**Purpose:** Delete all old generated files and start the pipeline from scratch (zero)  
**Safety Level:** SAFE - Only removes outputs, logs, and old DVC cache

---

## 🎯 What We're Deleting (Complete Clean Slate)

### Files & Folders to DELETE:
1. **Old Evaluation Reports** - 8 files from past runs
2. **MLflow Tracking Data** - All experiment history
3. **Old Logs** - All old pipeline execution logs  
4. **Old Predictions** - All past prediction results
5. **Old Preprocessed Data** - Sensor fusion CSVs from old runs
6. **DVC Cache** - Old cached versions (will re-download if needed)

### Files & Folders to KEEP:
1. **Raw Data** - `data/raw/*.xlsx` (original Garmin exports)
2. **Pretrained Model** - `models/pretrained/*.keras` (fine-tuned model)
3. **Reference Datasets** - `research_papers/*.csv` (anxiety & Garmin labeled)
4. **Code & Configs** - All source code, configs, Docker files
5. **Git Repository** - `.git/` folder (version control)

## 🧹 Step-by-Step Cleanup

### Method 1: PowerShell (Recommended - Fast & Safe)

**Run this PowerShell command:**

```powershell
# ============================================================

$confirm = Read-Host "Continue? Type 'YES' to confirm"
if ($confirm -eq "YES") {
    Remove-Item -Path "mlruns" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    Remove-Item -Path "mlflow.db" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

}

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "============================================================" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "✅ CLEANUP COMPLETE!" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "============================================================" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "Your workspace is now ready to restart from zero."
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "Next steps:"
Write-Host "  1. Verify raw data: ls data/raw/"

### Method 2: Manual Deletion (If you prefer file explorer)

**Delete these folders/files one by one:**

#### A. Evaluation Reports (SAFE to delete)
```
outputs/evaluation/
├── evaluation_20251208_145052.json     ❌ DELETE
├── evaluation_20251208_145052.txt      ❌ DELETE

mlflow.db                                ⚠️ DELETE
```

## 📊 DVC Cache Management

### Understanding DVC Files

Your DVC tracking files (.dvc) are stored in Git and point to actual data in cloud storage (or local cache).

**Current DVC Files (KEEP THESE):**
```
data/raw.dvc                    ✅ KEEP - Points to raw sensor data
data/processed.dvc              ✅ KEEP - Points to processed/fused data
data/prepared.dvc               ✅ KEEP - Points to windowed arrays
models/pretrained.dvc           ✅ KEEP - Points to pre-trained model
research_papers/*.csv.dvc       ✅ KEEP - Points to reference datasets
```

These `.dvc` files are small (kilobytes) and tracked in Git. They're pointers to the actual large files in DVC storage.

### Clean DVC Cache (Optional)

```powershell
# See what's in DVC cache
dvc cache dir

# Show cache usage
dvc cache status

# Clean unused cache entries (safe)
dvc gc --workspace

# Clean ALL cache (EXTREME - you'll need to re-download everything)
# Remove-Item -Path ".dvc/cache" -Recurse -Force
```

### Re-download Data After Cleanup

If you clean everything, restore from DVC:

```powershell
# Pull all tracked data back
dvc pull

# Or pull specific directories
dvc pull data/raw.dvc
dvc pull models/pretrained.dvc
```

---

## 🔄 Starting Fresh - Step by Step

### After Cleanup, Follow This Sequence:

**Step 1: Verify Core Files Still Exist**
```powershell
# Check raw data (should have 2 Excel files)
ls data/raw/*.xlsx

# Check pretrained model (should be ~18MB)
ls models/pretrained/*.keras

# Check Git is intact
git log --oneline | head -5
```

**Step 2: Clear and Prepare**
```powershell
# Make sure DVC is up to date
dvc pull

# Verify Python environment
conda activate thesis-mlops
pip list | grep -E "tensorflow|scikit|pandas"
```

**Step 3: Fresh Pipeline Run**
```powershell
# Step 1: Sensor fusion (raw → fused CSV)
python src/sensor_data_pipeline.py

# Step 2: Preprocessing (CSV → windowed arrays)
python src/preprocess_data.py --input data/preprocessed/sensor_fused_50Hz.csv --calibrate

# Step 3: Inference (arrays → predictions)
python src/run_inference.py

# Step 4: Evaluation (predictions → reports)
python src/evaluate_predictions.py
```

**Step 4: Start Services**
```powershell
# MLflow for tracking
docker-compose up -d mlflow
start http://localhost:5000

# Inference API
docker-compose up -d inference
start http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## 📝 Updated data/prepared Folder Structure (After Fresh Start)

**Currently has:**
```
data/prepared/
├── config.json                  ← Scaler config (OK to keep)
├── PRODUCTION_DATA_README.md    ← Documentation (OK to keep)
├── production_metadata.json     ← Metadata (can delete, will regenerate)
└── predictions/                 ← Empty folder for new predictions
```

**After fresh run will have:**
```
data/prepared/
├── production_X.npy             ← New prepared arrays
├── production_metadata.json     ← New metadata
├── config.json                  ← Scaler config
├── predictions/
│   ├── predictions_*.csv        ← New predictions
│   └── predictions_*.json       ← New metadata
└── PRODUCTION_DATA_README.md    ← Documentation
```

---

## 🆘 Recovery (If Cleanup Goes Wrong)

### If you accidentally deleted something important:

```powershell
# Check Git for deleted files
git log --full-history -- <filepath>

# Restore from Git
git restore <filepath>

# Restore from DVC
dvc pull <file.dvc>

# Restore everything
git restore .
dvc checkout
```

### If you lost MLflow data:

```powershell
# MLflow data can't be recovered (it's not in Git or DVC)
# But you can restart it fresh:
docker-compose up -d mlflow
# It will create new empty mlruns/ folder
```

# 2. Check model exists
$modelSize = (Get-Item models/pretrained/*.keras -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).Length
Write-Host "[✓] Model size: $([math]::Round($modelSize/1MB, 1)) MB (should be ~18MB)"

# 3. Check no old predictions

## 📌 Important Notes

1. **DVC files (.dvc) stay in Git** - They're small pointers, not actual data
2. **Raw data is safe** - Stored in DVC remote, easily restored with `dvc pull`
3. **Pretrained model is safe** - DVC-tracked, can restore anytime
4. **MLflow data is NOT versioned** - Once deleted, experiments are gone forever
5. **All logs are regenerated** - New logs created on each pipeline run
